# Korean Dramas Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores data analytics techniques using various libraries to analyze Korean drama data. The main goal is to demonstrate the application of different data analysis and machine learning tools on a dataset of Korean dramas.

## Libraries and Technologies Used

This project utilizes several Python libraries for data manipulation, web scraping, data visualization, and machine learning. Key libraries include:

- BeautifulSoup and requests (for web scraping)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- sklearn (for machine learning tasks)
  - CountVectorizer
  - LatentDirichletAllocation
- sqlite3 and SQLAlchemy (for database operations)
- json (for handling JSON data)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) containing various data analysis tasks, including:

1. Web scraping Korean drama data from Wikipedia
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Text analysis and topic modeling using sklearn
5. Database operations with SQLite
6. Actor/Actress analysis

## Key Features

- Web scraping and data collection from Wikipedia
- Data manipulation and analysis using Pandas
- Text analysis and topic modeling with sklearn
- Database operations using both sqlite3 and SQLAlchemy
- Visualization of data trends and patterns

## How to Use

To explore this project:

1. Download the data folder & .ipynb file
2. Open it in a Jupyter Notebook environment
3. Run the cells to see the analysis and results

No additional installation or setup is required beyond having the necessary Python libraries installed.

## Machine Learning Highlight

This project showcases the use of sklearn's machine learning capabilities, particularly:

- CountVectorizer for text feature extraction
- LatentDirichletAllocation for topic modeling

These tools are used to analyze and categorize drama genres based on their descriptions.
